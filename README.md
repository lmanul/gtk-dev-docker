# gtk-dev-docker

Easy GTK development environment using Docker

# Usage

Very simple:

* Edit `run` and set `GTK_SRC_LOCATION` to the location of the GTK+ source on your machine.
* `./run`

If Docker isn't installed on your system, run this for Debian-based distros:

`./setup_docker`

and log out and back in.
